**NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** is a Python library used for working with human language data (text). NLTK is widely used for data preparation.

To clean up NLP data effectively, we typically go through the following stages:
1.**Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.

2.**Stopword Removal**: Removing common words (like "is", "the", etc.) that donâ€™t carry meaningful information.

3.**Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
